Prominent examples include software, patents, recognizable brands, a strong organizational culture, and data-driven logistics. Academic research shows that intangibles have significantly grown in value over time. However, financial statements largely do not recognize the value of intangibles, in part because they are much harder to measure than tangible assets. Thus, it is feasible that investors do not correctly calculate the price of firms that rely heavily on intangibles.\n",

    "**Objective:** One simple example of a convergence arbitrage strategy is Pairs Trading. For this strategy, a fund identifies two or more securities that are closely related to each other. Theoretically, the securities' prices should co-move in the same direction over time, due to their similarities. The securities *might not* have exactly the same price, but the difference in their prices should be relatively stable over time. The strategy works by (i) identifying the securities; (ii) measuring the difference in their prices during \"normal\" trading periods; (iii) identifying any points in time where the difference in prices significantly deviates from the usual amount; and (iv) implementing a zero-net-cost arbitrage trade that earns a profit if the difference in prices shrinks back to the usual amount.  \n",

    "In this step, you will prepare data for implementing a Pairs Trading strategy using corporate bonds. Specifically, you will combine several datasets that contain bond-level and firm-level information, and then you will identify groups of similar bonds that could be used in Pairs Trading.
