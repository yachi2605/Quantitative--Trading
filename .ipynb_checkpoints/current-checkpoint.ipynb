Prominent examples include software, patents, recognizable brands, a strong organizational culture, and data-driven logistics. Academic research shows that intangibles have significantly grown in value over time. However, financial statements largely do not recognize the value of intangibles, in part because they are much harder to measure than tangible assets. Thus, it is feasible that investors do not correctly calculate the price of firms that rely heavily on intangibles.\n",

For each regression, store the estimated intercept (i.e., the alpha) and the intercept's p-value in a data frame. Next, re-estimate the same regressions over all months from January 2000 through December 2019, and store those alphas and p-values in the same data frame. This data frame should contain five columns: The portfolio number, the portfolio's alpha over the 1980--1999 period, the p-value of the portfolio's intercept over the 1980--1999 period, the portfolio's alpha over the 2000-2019 period, and the p-value of the portfolio's intercept over the 2000--2019 period. Print this data frame to an output file, and upload this file as part of your final submission."

    "**Objective:** One simple example of a convergence arbitrage strategy is Pairs Trading. For this strategy, a fund identifies two or more securities that are closely related to each other. Theoretically, the securities' prices should co-move in the same direction over time, due to their similarities. The securities *might not* have exactly the same price, but the difference in their prices should be relatively stable over time. The strategy works by (i) identifying the securities; (ii) measuring the difference in their prices during \"normal\" trading periods; (iii) identifying any points in time where the difference in prices significantly deviates from the usual amount; and (iv) implementing a zero-net-cost arbitrage trade that earns a profit if the difference in prices shrinks back to the usual amount.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you will prepare data for implementing a Pairs Trading strategy using corporate bonds. Specifically, you will combine several datasets that contain bond-level and firm-level information, and then you will identify groups of similar bonds that could be used in Pairs Trading. The purpose is to understand the underlying data work that must be completed, before a precise trading strategy can be designed.\n",

    "**Note:** For this step you can use Pandas, but are not required to.\n",

    "   - In this file, unsecured_indicator identifies whether or not the bond is backed by some collateral, which investors can receive and re-sell in case of bankruptcy.\n",
    "   - junior_indicator identifies whether or not the bond is junior in the priority order. In bankruptcy, these bonds are paid out only if sufficient cash is left after paying out senior bonds.\n",
    "   - convertible_indicator identifies whether or not the bond can be converted to equity, at the choice of the firm.\n",
    "- trace_linkfile.txt, which contains indicators matching individual bonds to the Compustat GVKEY of the firm that issued them\n",
